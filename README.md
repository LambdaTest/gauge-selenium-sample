## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing Java automation testing with Selenium, you would need to:

- Install the latest **Java development environment** i.e. **JDK 1.6** or higher. We recommend using the latest version.

- Download the latest **Selenium Client** and its **WebDriver bindings** from the [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). Latest versions of Selenium Client and WebDriver are ideal for running your automation script on LambdaTest Selenium cloud grid.

- Install **Maven**. It can be downloaded and installed following the steps from [the official website](https://maven.apache.org/). Maven can also be installed easily on **Linux/MacOS** using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

- Install the **Gauge** framework from its [official website](https://docs.gauge.org/getting_started/installing-gauge.html?os=windows&language=null&ide=null).

### Cloning Repo And Installing Dependencies

**Step 1:** Clone the LambdaTest‚Äôs Gauge-Selenium-Sample repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/gauge-selenium-sample
cd gauge-selenium-sample
```

You may also want to run the command below to check for outdated dependencies.

```bash
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
```

**Step 2:** Install the mandatory Selenium dependencies for Maven by running the below command:

```bash
mvn compile
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on Selenium Grid. You can get these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) or by your [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login).

**Step 3:** Set LambdaTest **Username** and **Access Key** in environment variables.

* For **Linux/macOS**:
  
  ```bash
  export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
  export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```
* For **Windows**:
  ```bash
  set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
  set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```

## Run Your First Test

>**Test Scenario**: Check out the sample script [StepImplementation_ToDo.java](https://github.com/LambdaTest/gauge-selenium-sample/blob/master/src/test/java/driver/driver/StepImplementation_ToDo.java) for running Gauge tests. This Gauge automation script test a sample to-do list app by marking couple items as done, adding a new item to the list and finally displaying the count of pending items as output.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

**Step 4:** In the test script, you need to update your test capabilities. In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:

```java
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
        capabilities.setCapability("browserName", "chrome");
        capabilities.setCapability("version", "latest");
        capabilities.setCapability("platform", "win10"); // If this cap isn't specified, it will just get the any available one
        capabilities.setCapability("build", "LambdaTestSampleApp");
        capabilities.setCapability("name", "LambdaTestJavaSample");

```
### Clearing Browser Cache after Test
```java
 // Clearing browser Cache after Test
        driver.manage().deleteAllCookies(); // delete all cookies
        Thread.sleep(7000); // wait 7 seconds to clear cookies.
```
You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of [Desired Capability Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/).

### Executing The Test

**Step 5:** The tests can be executed in the terminal using either of the following commands:

```bash
mvn test
```

or

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build). 

## Run Parallel Tests Using Gauge

To perform Gauge parallel testing, more than one browser specifications need to be updated in the [env folder](https://github.com/LambdaTest/gauge-selenium-sample/tree/master/env) of the project. 

For instance, we have defined specifications for Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge in the below screenshot. Once the test is executed, all parallel browser specifications will hit on the LambdaTest cloud grid and execute simultaneously.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70570645/170765173-b3ad947e-003f-4e64-a2dd-5bc64c99bcef.png)

In case you‚Äôd need to chuck out test for any browser, you would need to either delete the folder or comment out the code in it.

### Executing Parallel Tests Using Gauge

To run parallel tests using **Gauge**, we would have to execute the same command we had used for single test which would be:

```bash
mvn test OR mvn clean install
```

## Testing Locally Hosted Or Privately Hosted Projects

You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with LambdaTest Selenium grid using LambdaTest Tunnel. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using tunnel and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are live.

Refer our [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

Here‚Äôs how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

Download the binary file of:
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for macOS](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:

```bash
LT -user {user‚Äôs login email} -key {user‚Äôs access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:

```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**

```java
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();        
        capabilities.setCapability("tunnel", true);
```
